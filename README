This is a Xen xm command completion script. You can append it to your .bashrc or profile, etc.
to make it effect.


If you prefer to use xm's original function, just type: export XENXM=off on your bash. (another optional value: on)


I have another idea to speed the function _xm():
Make a cache to store domain's detail information when create or destroy a domain. Then when you <TAB> function _xm() will
search info from the cache, not execute shell command to obtion the info. such as (hot plug
device number)

Feel free to make a contribution to it.
